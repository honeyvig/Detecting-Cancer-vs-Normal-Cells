Chemical Properties of Cancerous Cells

Cancer cells differ significantly from normal cells in their chemical composition, metabolism, and behavior. Below is an outline of their distinguishing features and properties.
Differences Between Normal Cells and Cancerous Cells
Feature	Normal Cells	Cancerous Cells
Growth Regulation	Controlled growth, regulated by checkpoints.	Uncontrolled growth, ignores cell cycle checkpoints.
Energy Metabolism	Aerobic respiration using mitochondria.	Increased glycolysis (Warburg effect), even in oxygen presence.
Genetic Stability	Stable DNA with normal repair mechanisms.	Genetic instability with frequent mutations.
Apoptosis	Undergo programmed cell death when damaged.	Resist apoptosis, avoiding death signals.
Angiogenesis	Limited angiogenesis (blood vessel formation).	Excessive angiogenesis to sustain rapid growth.
Contact Inhibition	Stop growing upon contact with other cells.	Lack contact inhibition, leading to overgrowth.
Chemical Components in Cancerous Cells

    Altered Metabolites:
        Lactic Acid: Overproduced due to high glycolysis.
        ATP Levels: Often reduced despite rapid growth.

    Proteins:
        Mutant p53 Protein: Common in cancer cells, preventing apoptosis.
        Bcl-2: Anti-apoptotic protein overexpressed in many cancers.
        VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor): Promotes angiogenesis.

    Lipids:
        Elevated lipid synthesis, particularly phospholipids, supports rapid membrane production.

    Nucleic Acids:
        Increased oncogene activation (e.g., MYC, RAS).
        Suppression of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., TP53, RB1).

    Enzymes:
        Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for glycolysis.
        Overactive matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for tissue invasion.

Detection Methods

    Biopsy and Histology:
        Examination of cell structure under a microscope.

    Imaging Techniques:
        CT, MRI, and PET scans to visualize tumor locations.

    Blood Tests:
        Measure tumor markers like CA-125 (ovarian cancer), PSA (prostate cancer).

    Genetic Tests:
        Identify mutations in genes like BRCA1/2 or EGFR.

    Liquid Biopsy:
        Analyze circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or tumor cells in the blood.

    Metabolic Imaging:
        Detect altered glucose uptake using FDG-PET scans.

Procedures to Destroy Cancer Cells
1. Traditional Treatments

    Surgery: Physical removal of the tumor.
    Chemotherapy:
        Uses drugs like Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, or Paclitaxel to target rapidly dividing cells.
    Radiation Therapy:
        High-energy rays to damage DNA of cancer cells.

2. Advanced Therapies

    Immunotherapy:
        Checkpoint Inhibitors (e.g., Pembrolizumab): Block immune suppression by cancer cells.
        CAR-T Cell Therapy: Genetically engineered T cells target cancer.

    Targeted Therapy:
        Drugs like Imatinib target specific cancer-related proteins.

    Hormonal Therapy:
        Blocks hormones fueling cancer, such as Tamoxifen for breast cancer.

3. Cutting-Edge Techniques

    CRISPR Gene Editing:
        Modify cancer cell DNA to inhibit growth.

    Nanotechnology:
        Deliver drugs directly to cancer cells using nanoparticles.

    Photodynamic Therapy:
        Light-activated drugs to destroy cancerous tissues.

    Hyperthermia:
        Heat cancer cells to damage their structure.

How Cancer Cells Can Be Destroyed

    Apoptosis Induction:
        Reactivate apoptotic pathways with drugs targeting Bcl-2.

    Metabolic Disruption:
        Use glycolysis inhibitors like 2-deoxyglucose.

    Angiogenesis Inhibition:
        Block VEGF using agents like Bevacizumab.

    DNA Damage:
        Exploit the lack of DNA repair in cancer cells with drugs like PARP inhibitors.

Promising Future Technologies

    AI-Based Diagnosis:
        Algorithms for early detection through imaging and genomic data.
    Bioprinted Tumors:
        Test treatments on lab-grown tumors.
    Personalized Medicine:
        Tailored treatments based on individual genetic profiles.

By understanding these chemical and biological differences, early detection, targeted treatment, and prevention of cancer can become more effective.
